If you do not understand what any of this means, you can safely disregard this file.

1) You can customize mpv's options by setting its config file (located in the 'mpv' folder).
   More details can be found in the options file.

2) If you are trying to play non-English subtitles and some letters/characters show up corrupted,
   try deleting the 'fonts.conf' file under 'mpv' folder. This will make fontconfig start
   caching fonts. This process will only happen once for now, but will happen again if you add or
   remove a font from your system.
