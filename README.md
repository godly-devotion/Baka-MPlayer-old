# [Baka MPlayer](http://bakamplayer.u8sand.net)

## IMPORTANT UPDATE

The Baka MPlayer project has been restarted here
**https://github.com/u8sand/Baka-MPlayer**

I am please to announce that we are working on the next generation of Baka MPlayer.
So what's changed?

* The new Baka MPlayer has been coded from the ground up by a different, more experienced programmer.
* We've switched from mpv to **libmpv**, making it easier to update our code.
* We've switched from .Net to Qt thereby achieving a faster, lighter, and best of all, cross-platform media player.

## Introduction

Baka MPlayer is a free and open source, **mpv** based multimedia player.
It's simple design reflects the idea for an uncluttered, simple, and enjoyable environment for watching anime.
It also supports opening Youtube videos (through **mpv**), is portable, and has support for voice commands (in beta).

## System Requirements

In order to run the executable, you require:
* Windows Vista SP2 or newer
* .NET Framework 3.5

## Develop

In order to open this project, you require:

* Windows 7 SP1 or newer
* Visual Studio 2013 or newer

###Note
The `mpv.exe` included in the Debug folder is 64-bit!
If you want to debug in a 32-bit environment, download the 32-bit version of
Baka MPlayer and use the `mpv.exe` included in there.
